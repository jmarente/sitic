Sitic is a framework for making general-purpose websites. Technically speaking, Sitic is a static website generator.
Unlike other systems that dynamically generate a page each time a visitor requests it, Sitic creates the site
once only, when you create its content. Because websites are viewed much more frequently than they are edited.

Sites built with Sitic are significantly faster and safer than a dynamically generated site.
Can be hosted anywhere, including GitHub Pages, Google Cloud Storage or Amazon
S3 among others. Sitic sites run without relying on expensive runtimes such as Ruby, Python
or PHP and without dependence on any database.
